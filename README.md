# People-Profile-Generator

This project is a python based Flask web application that generates realistic fictional identities for testing and development purposes. 

## How to Use

When you run the app.py file, you will be taken to the homepage of the application. This contains information about the program and how some of the data could be used.

Once you hit "Get Started", you are brought to the Profile Dashboard. Here, you can input a range of filters to create more specific data sets of profiles.

Once you create your profiles, they will be displayed below the filter box. From here, you can remove all profiles at the bottom, or individual profiles by clicking on the trashcan in the corner of the profile. You can also view a profile in more detail by clicking on it.

Inside the profile viewer page, you will see a detailed list of this person's information. Every person has education data, career data, and a father and mother who's profiles you can view.

You can also click on the company a person works for and be brought to a business viewer page to see more information about that business.
